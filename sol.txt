q8: generic views of Django is a kind of built-in view templates.
    The benefits of using it is saving time on coding regular pages.
    When we only have few requirements for the display of the view, we could use the view,
    such as the admin page of a website. Admins do not need a beautiful page. It doesn't mean
    anything to them.
    But when we need to make a creative view with tons of user requirements, generic views
    are not enough. It would be better to code the view from scratch to make it
    perfectly fits our needs.
